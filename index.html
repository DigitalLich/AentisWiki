                    The mist and the rain of ashes have been running wild throught for thousands of years leaving the people to find
                    thier own way to survive. Until 750 years ago, the sky open up for a brief moment of the day and the sun shined 
                    through the ashes signaling the end of the Era of Ashes marking what is now known as the Era of Equilibrium.
                    People from all the world looked at this a s hope and opportunity, and the race for power and control began.
                    Nations started to rise, wars strated to brew, and conflict is still anew.

                    but not good or evil. The world is constantly revolutionizing itself, and the people must adapt to it or be left behind.
