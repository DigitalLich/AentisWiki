                <p>
                    The mist and the rain of ashes have been running wild throught for thousands of years leaving the people to find
                    thier own way to survive. Until 750 years ago, the sky open up for a brief moment of the day and the sun shined 
                    through the ashes signaling the end of the Era of Ashes marking what is now known as the Era of Equilibrium.
                    People from all the world looked at this a s hope and opportunity, and the race for power and control began.
                    Nations started to rise, wars strated to brew, and conflict is still anew.

                    An epic fantasy setting with a focus of medievalish society and culture. It focused itself
                    in to the politics of rising nations, the influence of several deities in the world, the consequences of appraoching an
                    industrial revolution, and the discovery of ancient secrets sealed away for unknown reasons. <br/>
                    
                    It's a world where it seemes that always is a tipping balance trying to kept itself in check between chaos and order
                    but not good or evil. The world is constantly revolutionizing itself, and the people must adapt to it or be left behind.
