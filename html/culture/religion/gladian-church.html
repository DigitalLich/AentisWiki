                <p>
                    The Gladian Church or Church of Gladia is a local Hestein religion. It originated in the North of the 
                    <a href=html/georg/eusacix/hestein-empire.html>Hestein Empire</a> through "The Great Stabilization." 
                    The Gladia Church influence is enormous among the aristocrats. The fundamental values of the church coordinate so well with the nobility's values that some 
                    noble families participate directly on the church. The religion centers around 4 deities, which they believe are the symbol of noblesse. 
                    These deities are Dhoven, Evmus, Knoqia and Nuria.
